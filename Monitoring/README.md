# Cloud Monitoring

## What Is Cloud Monitoring ?
- Cloud monitoring is a broad category that includes monitoring of web and cloud applications, infrastructure, networks, platform, application, and micro-services.

## Four Golden Signals That Should Be Monitored.

   1. Latency - Time taken by the host server to approve the request of a real user. 
   2. Traffic -  The load users put on an application. All the users using an application are combined to measure the total load. Real-time monitoring is essential. 
   3. Errors - Should be identified in real-time and, AI for application monitoring is the only solution. HTTP errors - rectified. 
   4. Saturation - is defined as percentage of an application or software system being used. High saturation results in performance degradation. 

## Benefits of cloud monitoring

- Monitoring is crucial to make sure that all the services which you are using on the cloud are running smoothly and efficiently. Such a strategy should focus on identifying when service-level objectives (SLOs) are not being met, likely negatively affecting the user experience. So, then what are the benefits of leveraging cloud monitoring tools? With cloud monitoring:

   - Scaling for increased activity is seamless and works in organizations of any size
   - Dedicated tools (and hardware) are maintained by the host
   - Tools are used across several types of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and phones, so your organization can monitor apps from any location
   - Installation is simple because infrastructure and configurations are already in place
   - Your system doesn’t suffer interruptions when local problems emerge, because resources aren’t part of your organization’s servers and workstations
   - Subscription-based solutions can keep your costs low

## Types of Monitoring:

1. **Database monitoring**
   - Because most cloud applications rely on databases, this technique reviews processes, queries, availability, and consumption of cloud database resources. This technique can also track queries and data integrity, monitoring connections to show real-time usage data. For security purposes, access requests can be tracked as well. For example, an uptime detector can alert if there’s database instability and can help improve resolution response time from the precise moment that a database goes down.

2. **Website monitoring**
   - A website is a set of files that is stored locally, which, in turn, sends those files to other computers over a network. This monitoring technique tracks processes, traffic, availability, and resource utilization of cloud-hosted sites.

3. **Virtual network monitoring**
   - This monitoring type creates software versions of network technology such as firewalls, routers, and load balancers. Because they’re designed with software, these integrated tools can give you a wealth of data about their operation. If one virtual router is endlessly overcome with traffic, for example, the network adjusts to compensate. Therefore, instead of swapping hardware, virtualization infrastructure quickly adjusts to optimize the flow of data.

4. **Cloud storage monitoring**
   - This technique tracks multiple analytics simultaneously, monitoring storage resources and processes that are provisioned to virtual machines, services, databases, and applications. This technique is often used to host infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions. For these applications, you can configure monitoring to track performance metrics, processes, users, databases, and available storage. It provides data to help you focus on useful features or to fix bugs that disrupt functionality.

5. **Virtual machine monitoring**
   - This technique is a simulation of a computer within a computer; that is, virtualization infrastructure and virtual machines. It’s usually scaled out in IaaS as a virtual server that hosts several virtual desktops. A monitoring application can track the users, traffic, and status of each machine. You get the benefits of traditional IT infrastructure monitoring with the added benefit of cloud monitoring solutions.
